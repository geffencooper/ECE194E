Hi all,

Hope that you are well. Given the recent potential Covid-19 exposure in class, we will have the office hour on Monday over zoom since my office is quite small. We will still hold the class in person at 3:30 but I think it would be good to wear masks. Here is the zoom link for the office hour at 11 AM on Monday:

Hi all,

Hi all,

I feel a bit under the weather. We will not have a class today; we will continue on Wednesday where I will review some materials for midterm and then move to Markov Decision Processes. Please note that the midterm is on Monday 5/23 in class. It covers the first 3 HWs and material in lecture notes up to and excluding Hidden Markov Models.

Best,

Ramtin.

Hi all,

Note that you can use the notes for the midterm exam on Monday. You can bring your laptop but you are only allowed to use the material on Gauchospace.

Best,

Hi all,

I will be attending a conference out of town next week. We will not have an office hour on Monday and Mark is going to administer the exam. We are going to have a lecture on Wednesday taught by Mark on Q Learning. I am available to answer questions over email if needed. We will have office hours on Tuesday 31st at 11 the following week since Monday 30th is a holiday. 

Best,

Hi all,

Since Monday is a holiday, we are going to have the last office hour on Tuesday at 9:45-10:45 AM. The final project report is due Wednesday June 8th 11:59 PM. As you know, there can be two types of projects: 1) implementing ML algorithm(s) learned in the class on a real data set you find online and do comparisons, conclusions, show plots, and share your code together with a 3-4 page report. This can be at the level of labs 2-4 so basically design a new lab with report; 2) read and study a related machine learning research paper and write a summary in a report or survey paper discussing the algorithm, results, strengths and weaknesses. 

Best,

Ramtin.
